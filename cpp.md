# C++

- I first started out with C++, and much later learned Python.  Some say you get a different kind of engineer from the one that learns Python first and then has to learn C.  I understood the call stack, walked through things slowly with the **gdb** tool, made a game loop with it, etc.

- Olimar's Escape.  My first text-based RPG game.  It features a game loop - of course - and is incomplete, but taught me that things can get big really quickly.
