# Things I've done with C++

- I first started out with C++, and much later learned Python.  Some say you get a different kind of engineer from the one that learns Python first and then has to learn C.  I understood the call stack, walked through things slowly with the **gdb** tool, made a game loop with it, etc.  The first compiler that I found that worked decent was Borland C++, which is still around today.  I used to lookup www.cplusplus.com **constantly**, and that web site is still up and looks the same.

- Olimar's Escape.  My first text-based RPG game.  It features a game loop - of course - and is incomplete, but taught me that things can get big really quickly.

- I kind of got into the Boost libraries but didn't stay around for too long, it turns out.

- I once found the DexDrive Linux C code on the 3rd page of a Google search, and then downloaded it compiled it and ran it, in order to save songs I had made on a video game for a Playstation memory card.  It's a non-standard device, that you feed your memory cards into, and it can transfer the data to your computer for backup purposes.  The device surely works for Windows, but I had to find the code online for Linux, and it was in some random person's repository.
