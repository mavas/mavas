# Arduino kit

To demonstrate some recent experience with embedded software development, I opened up an old Arduino kit that I got back in the day.  It has a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and 16GB NOOBS, Arduino Shield model Ethernet without PoE, Arduino Uno, and various other hardware pieces you can use to build what appears to be a car that rolls on 4 wheels.
