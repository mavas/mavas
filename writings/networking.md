# My experience with computer networking

There are many, many different areas of expertise when in comes to computers, be it embedded systems, databases, graphics, operating systems, libraries, etc., but my focus and natural interest tended to focus on computer networking and network security.  Here's some ideas about my past with them.

- **I have formal education that specialized in computer networking**.  At my university, for a computer science degree, a student can choose 1 of 3 focuses: computer graphics, databases, or computer networking.  I chose the third one, and was very certain about it too (I don't care about graphics that much, or databases, but computer networks are pretty important and complex, like the Internet).

- I'm familiar with a lot of networking tools, like NMap, Kismet, aircrack-ng, snort, Metasploit.

- Twisted is a related networking programming library.  You can make custom servers with it.  In other words, there are lots of **complete** servers already out there (PostgreSQL, OpenLDAP, Apache HTTP, etc.), but this library lets you create custom servers, in case you need to do that.
