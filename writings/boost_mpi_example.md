# Boost MPI example

This page describes a message passing interface (MPI) example I've concocted.

## How this demonstration works

Docker Compose is used to create several 'computers', with an example Boost MPI C++ program running on each one, and these computers work together to perform a computation/calculation, properly demonstrating the use of message passing interface.
