# My use of Linux

- Ever since I first tried Linux, I've always used Linux.  I used to use Microsoft Windows; Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows 10 Pro.  I used the Borland C++ compiler to create programs, and I made a Notepad GUI clone via the WIN32 API.  The operating system has all kinds of things I wouldn't call 'bugs' but quarks, and little things unique to it.

- Ubuntu is pretty important.  I used to go around school with spare Ubuntu 1.0 CDs just to hand them out to people.  And it was very questionable compared to the Ubuntu 2021 that I'm writing this on.  It's used a lot in the cloud too.  You can do ALL kinds of development with it; despite it looking and feeling so polished.  Counter Strike Global Offensive runs natively on Linux now, and error-free on Ubuntu, and I've had no issues with it mostly.

- Gentoo is a personal favorite.  Very much based on source code.  Extremely flexible.  It requires understanding too much though, and so I'm now on Ubuntu.  The best thing about Gentoo is that it helps you see and understand just exactly what a piece of software is capable of, just because you're required to manually set each USE flag.

- Oddly enough, FreeBSD was my first operating system.  A friend merely mentioned it, and I tried it.  It was an ok experience, but more bad than good, because the machine wasn't connected to the Internet in any way, and there was no graphical interface.  I ran commands and read their manual pages.  Its ports system made sense, but looks strange nowadays compared to Gentoo's portage system.  I hear Yahoo! uses heavily modified versions of FreeBSD.  The Apple Mac operating system is a modified FreeBSD; the Playstation 3 and 4 use a modified FreeBSD.
