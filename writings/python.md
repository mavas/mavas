# Python is my best programming language

Here's some writeup about my Python use.  It turns out to be wide/varied/broad, covering many different types of libraries/frameworks.

- Took a Python assessment and ranked very high.  A recruiting company asked that I take an assessment for Python.  I've done them before, but this one was different in that it was of higher quality, or something.  It was more serious.  I still did very good.

- **[the standard library]**.  I do make use of the standard library.  It's very broad and helpful, well thought-out, and cohesive.  It's not vary glamorous, but is of course always available.

- **[Web development]**.  I've dealt with Django a lot.  So this is a lot of web development server side things.

- **[custom asynchronous networking]**.  I've dealt with Twisted.  Twisted is all about writing custom networking code, either on the server side or the client side.  You can make a video game or a game server with it, for example.  **scrapyd** and **scrapy** are written in Twisted.  You can containerize a Twisted app and launch it in the cloud easily.

- **[search engines]**.  I've dealt with Whoosh, which is a search engine library.  So, search science.  It let's you create custom search engines for custom content.
