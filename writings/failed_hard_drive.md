# Failed laptop encrypted hard drive

Linux Unified Key Setup, reading its source code, learning its commands, and running 'dd'

I came home to find that my primary laptop's hard drive failed, and I had to just deal with it. I had to learn and deal with the LUKS Linux encryption file system thing, not only having to discover/learn/run new commands (like cryptsetup, and luksOpen), but dealing with the source code itself of those command line tools. All of the data was valuable, so I had to be careful, and so I had to know exactly what was going on, so dealing with these commands, and their source code, was important to proceed with; thankfully the code was rather short. I had to run the dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb command in attempts to at least perfectly mirror/backup the data, so that you can simply install Ubuntu back on it and the hard drive will be good as new, but I ran in to some errors with that command, and so now I'm stuck, and the laptop is just sitting here. In the meantime it was fastest though to just use my older laptop for job hunting, and then get a job, and then get back to the issue. Anyway, I usually use Ubuntu, and sometimes its using some transperant encryption thing underneath as the file system, and the point is is that it really is a transperant thing, meaning you're not supposed to really need to think about it. But with this issue, it suddenly became the issue and one then has to dig under the hood and discover and learn about and deal with yet another new layer of software stuff.
