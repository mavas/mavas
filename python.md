# Python is my best programming language

Here's some writeup about my Python use.  It's meant to be wide and varied, to display the different things Python can do, and the different things I've done with Python.

- Took a Python assessment and ranked very high.  A recruiting company asked that I take an assessment for Python.  I've done them before, but this one was different in that it was of higher quality, or something.  It was more serious.  I still did very good.

- I do make use of the standard library.  It's very broad and helpful, well thought-out, and cohesive.

- I've dealt with Django a lot.  So this is a lot of web development server side stuff.

- I've dealt with Twisted.  Twisted is all about writing custom networking code, either on the server side or the client side.  You can make a video game or a game server with it, for example.

- I've dealt with Whoosh, which is a search engine library.  So, search science.  It let's you create custom search engines for custom content.
